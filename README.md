# StickerSmash

Part of mastering my react native skills, I have built a sticker app. That allows users to pick a picture and add emojis onto that picture.

The components of my learning journey include:
1. Building React Native application
2. Building a screen
3. Using an image picker
4. Creating a modal
5. Adding gestures
6. Take a screenshot
7. Handling platform differences
8. Congifuring status bar, splash screen and app icon
